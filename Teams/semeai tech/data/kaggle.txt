A great cuticle remover is 'must' product for every manicure. Some cost-cutting salons will use a cuticle oil as a substitute, but they have two very different purposes.

Trauma to this area can cause improper nail growth forever, so be careful.

The neck and dÃ©colletÃ© are, after the face, the two zones that are the most sensitive to the effects of aging.

Its re-densifying action is reinforced by an anti-slackening affect. After the treatment, the neck and dÃ©colletÃ© appear immediately smoothed, as if lifted. Spots are diminished and the dÃ©colletÃ© recovers a satiny radiance. With continued use, the skin recovers its strength and tone; it appears denser, stronger and firmer.
The supremely rich texture of the new Rich Cream offers the global anti-aging power of Orchidee Imperiale with a new age-defying Imperial Orchid Molecular Extract, drawn from the roots, stems, and leaves of three new orchids that are rich in growth tissue. The reformulated cream also features the Nourishing Orchid Concentrate: a unique combination of orchid butter and orchid oil which targets fragility, roughness, and lack of flexibility in dry skin. Skin recovers its strength and density, facial contours appear redefined, and wrinkles are smoothed. Nourished and freed from dryness, the skin regains the suppleness, comfort, and elasticity of young skin.
This essential first step to the anti-aging ritual maximizes the OrchidÃ©e ImpÃ©riale skincare benefits. Enriched with orchid water, this toner primes the skin with preliminary age-defying action and deeply moisturizes and enhances skin density in an instant, refining its texture. After use, the skin is firmer, smoother and pores are tightened.

A lash system for 25% longer, thicker lashes in just 2 weeks! (And the results get ridiculously more impressive, showing 40% improvement in 4 weeks, and 63% in 6 weeks.) Prove it to yourself. When we overheard a cry in our office of 'this s*** really works!', we knew we had to share the secret. Who wouldnâ€™t want to boost their lash cache? This double-ended miracle worker holds TWO products that really perform. These are clinical results you can take to the beauty bank. â€“ 25% longer and thicker in 2 weeks â€“ 40% in 4 weeks â€“ 63% in 6 weeks How does this stuff work? The clear gel-like serum accelerates the growth of your lashes with peptides. Use the tiny brush to apply it at your lash line. It penetrates at the root and stimulates keratin to lengthen, thicken and fortify your lashes. Simply brush it on each night before bed. The conditioning mask applies with a wand and loads your lashes with growth peptides and high potency ingredients like Panthenol and Vitamin E. Your conditioned lashes can now resist loss and breakage from being too dry and brittle. All this all adds up to incredible lash magnification! Now if only your Blackberry worked this well...
You love our longest-lasting products, but how do you take them off?! This nourishing formula will ensure that makeup removal doesnâ€™t throw you into fits. Sometimes you need a makeup remover that's as mighty as the most powerful products in your beauty arsenal, which is why we've created Meltdown! This stuff can take down our longest-lasting products, and it's also good for your skin, too. Sea Fan Extract combats inflammation, while Beta Carotene (a source of Vitamin A) and Gatuline In-Tense (harvested from the South African Rain Forest Peekabo Plant) revitalize collagen production. Cranberry and Raspberry Seed Oils, along with Kukui Nut and Oat Oil, moisturize and replenish. The 2.5 oz. squeeze tube is easy to use, as well as small enough to take on an airplane (after a long grueling flight, you'll be so glad you brought it with you).

An explosion of prismatic sparkle against a wash of color... Miniscule bits of sophisticated glitter give you sexy, twinkling lids. No fallout, no teen glitter. It's something unexpected in eyeshadow: an explosion of stars. Stardust shadows' silky texture delivers an incredible amount of sophisticated, twinkling sparkle. Boasting 40% more glitter than our most sparkly shadows, Stardust delivers a sheer wash of color, topped with teeny bits of iridescent sparkle that glisten like wet snow. The glitter (a pricey ingredient called reflex), actually stays on your lids. No fallout, no chunky glitter... just stunning, sparkling eyes.
Inspired by twinkling stars, our radiant formula wraps lips in sophisticated (never scratchy) sparkle. Lip conditioners and a minty taste up the ante. Our Stardust Shadow has attracted a pretty obsessive fan base, so we decided to launch this arresting gloss for all you sparkle fanatics. Teeny glints of sparkle reflect light, and the result is a deep, dynamic car paint effect: a sophisticated, lustrous shine that makes lips look fuller. The multifaceted shades work every day, but can amp up your nighttime looks as well. It's twinkling sparkle without the look (or scratchiness) of teenage glitter. This formula is thicker than your average gloss, but doesn't feel that way. Cushiony, but not sticky, Stardust has staying power and nourishes, too: Jojoba Oil conditions lips, Vitamin E improves moisture retention, and a vanilla-mint flavor keeps things interesting for your makeout partner. The clear, rectangular tube shows off color and sparkle â€“ it's like a slice of outer space in a tube â€“ and you won't be able to keep your hands off the soft-touch black cap. Pull this out of your bag, and you'll captivate the room.

Pull it together â€“ groomed brows AMPLIFY your eyes. Our clear setting gel provides natural, lasting hold and the styling brush sculpts with precision. Groomed brows should NEVER feel (or look) stiff or sticky, so our clear brow gel provides lasting hold for a more polished look that's always natural. The mini brush is more effective for grooming the brows than a traditional spiral brush â€“ Wende was inspired by the ol' 'spraying hairspray on a toothbrush' trick! If you already wear brow gel, you'll be AMAZED at the effectiveness of the brush. Never tried it before? Just brush our formula on, and see for yourself how much better your brows will suddenly look. The soft-touch tube is sleek and tactile.

What it is: An illuminating powder that delivers pure radiance. What it does: Inspired by light and created by Guerlain, MÃ©tÃ©orites Pearls employ the technology of white light, which is used in photography and film to erase imperfections and soften features. A constellation of 6 multi-colored pearls blend together for a flawless, radiant complexion. These pearls-with-a-purpose have now been reinvented in 3 color harmonies that are adapted to each skintone.
Each shade of MÃ©tÃ©orites Pearls begins with the same legendary combination of 3 colors which adapt to every skin tone and collectively work to beautify skin: mauve catches the light, pink refreshes and yellow counters dullness and corrects redness. These delicate and perfectly round pearls continue to be shaped by hand, with craftsmanship mastered by only 4 people in the world. Softer than ever, the new pearls allow for an even easier application and a more visible effect with every brushstroke. These precious pearls are contained in a beautiful metal tin, now marked with a new emblem of a reinterpreted rosette created with a light gradation of pink.

Quick and easy makeup application to achieve a flawless finish. Carefully arranged bristles create an angled brush surface and synthetic fibers extend slightly further than the goat hair. This specification means that the bristles have more spring and it enables them to pick up just the right amount of product. This helps create a smooth finish to your makeup, while also helping it last even longer. The brush works perfectly with any type of foundation - liquid, cream and even powder.
Our small, angled highlighter brush. When you use this brush, use light strokes as if you were removing excess product. This enables you to achieve a natural but glamorous finish.

saw how CRAZY everyone went over Chaos (a brilliant matte blue), we realized our fans craved bright

ultimate fix for color addicts, this gorgeous palette is packed with ten of the brightest, most amazing
shades youâ€™ve ever laid eyes on. In addition to Chaos (yes, itâ€™s back!), this palette marks the return

mattes to highly dimensional shimmers, each VELVETY shade delivers insane color payout. Why
do a Pressed Pigment Palette? Using pressed pigments was the only way to create heavily saturated

For maximum coverage: Use fingertip and tap onto skin. A synthetic brush will also work well for more precise placement, however, finger application will have the most intense pigment lay-down. To blend: Use a fluffy brush that has good movement, dip tip of the brush into the pressed pigment and blend. This will make your colour softer and more diffused (like a total pro). When finished: Close that sucker up tight! Donâ€™t leave the jar opened for long periods of time, you may lose some of the magic that makes the Super Shock Pressed Pigments so amazzzing. *Not intended for use in the immediate eye area.

Rouge Bunny Rouge fine fragrances - ambassadors of the Enchanted Garden - set forth to explore the olfactory abundance of precious woody notes. With Arcadia, a mesmerising new star is born: an intense perfume inspired by visions of exotic rain forests and desert sands from outer space. Paying homage to the mythological Arcadia, a powerful source of fine art inspiration throughout the centuries, Rouge Bunny Rouge founder Alexandra de Montfort and perfumer Sonia Constant (Givaudan) have created an idyllic extra-terrestrial landscape. In this contrasting Eau de Parfum the bold spirit of an intellectual challenge meets the spellbinding expectations of unseen pleasures. A woody metallic floral, Arcadia opens with fragrant harmonies of exotic trees glistening in the rain, an unspoilt otherworldly wilderness. In its heart, an intense bouquet of vibrant, fruity flowers is embraced by hot metallic and dry mineral notes. As the fragrance unfolds, all those facets - bitter, sweet, hot, cold, humid, dry and spicy â€“ scintillate, adorning one another like electric sparks. Aristocratic, mischievous and ambrosial like an excellent white wine, Arcadia is a delicious artisanal fragrance.
Embers accepts no reproach, exacting attention with tiny sparks of pink pepper, nutmeg and clove; hot and cold spices in balanced contrast. This landscape of tempered heat engages the emotions, wrapping and weaving with obscured familiarity. Gently stoked incense rises, trailing memories of sunlit mahogany temples, the warmth of ritual fires and the smooth-cool touch of ancient stone. An enveloping mystic aroma grounded by resinous styrax and labdanumâ€™s ambery tones. Together lending a soft, opulent incandescence that smoulders with the promise of something equally beautiful emerging again. Sandalwoodâ€™s milky nuance and evocative aroma of young green woods, coupled with Peru balsamâ€™s seductive billows, continues the deeply pure signature. When roused by the heat of the skin the eagerly awaiting embers of this modern oriental are ready to leap and burn again, renewed from what it once was to even brighter flame.

A dual-fiber, multi-tasking brush with 3 coverage levels-full, medium and sheer. Now instead of fussing with three separate brushes, you can reach for just this one-whether you need different levels of coverage on various parts of your face, or want all-over fuller coverage during the workweek and lighter coverage on weekends. 
Because concealer alone sometimes just doesn't cut it, we've developed this breakthrough to prep for application that immediately wakens and brightens skin. Photo Op can be used on any area of the face to highlight and add radiance, too. 
Fall in love with your skinâ€”before you put on makeupâ€”with the first ever primer specially formulated in a lightweight, lustrous oil.

To de-stress your morning routine, calming chamomile and lavender oils sooth senses while the light veil reduces the appearance of dry, fine lines and makes you glow.

There are two universal truths about black liquid liner: It can never be too black or too perfect. Nail the look every time with Perversion Waterproof Fine-Point Eye Pen. This super-smooth, free-flowing pen lays down blacker-than-black lines with absolute precision. Our waterproof formula glides on without skipping or pulling, and the ultra fine tip provides an insane amount of control for a flawless application. Create thin, fine lines and bold, thick lines like a total proâ€”even if youâ€™re not! This pen is so good, even those who normally shy away from liquid liner will have their technique perfected in no time. Like all of our Perversion products, the color payoff is amazing (and intensely black!). And once youâ€™ve applied it, the ink dries down quickly; wonâ€™t smudge, run or feather; and lasts ALL day.
Naked Skin Color Correcting Fluid is the next generation of skin perfection and radiance. Use these shades to correct imperfections and play up your best features, all without having to lug around a whole contour kit. Unlike a lot of cream-based color correctors, our liquid formula is easy to use and always blends beautifullyâ€”whether you use a little or a lot. Special pigment technology provides a smooth, even application every time. (And we based our formula off of Naked Skin Concealer, so you know itâ€™s weightless and crazy good.)
Liquid Liner was one of our original color products, and weâ€™re always reinventing and improving it. Since we can never get enough color, we also wanted to expand our range with more dimensional shades and multiple finishes. The name comes from one of our photographers, who used to look in the lens and whisper, â€œOoh, thatâ€™s razor sharp.â€ We thought the delivery was funny, but it also sounded like a good name for liquid liner. The precision brush really lives up to the monikerâ€”itâ€™s practically impossible to mess up. Still perfecting your technique? After giving the bottle a good shake, lean your elbow on a stable surface to keep your hand steady while you apply. Then, just draw down into your lashes so the upper part of the line is sharp and even.
Get bigger, blacker, badder lashes with our ultra-creamy, lengthening and volumizing mascara. So intense you might need a safe word, Perversion glides on and gets you sexy in one stroke. (Yet it wonâ€™t quit until you say when.) Itâ€™s insane how black it isâ€¦the purest, deepest, most intense black color imaginable.
Perversion has a creamy, full-bodied texture thatâ€™s not too dry, not too wet. This allows just the right amount of â€œpullâ€ so it glides through lashes. The result: incredible control for insane lashes. Go ahead and pile on coat after coat. Want to apply more before you go out at night? No problem. Even if itâ€™s been all day since you applied, more Perversion always means more beautiful lashes. Our formula NEVER gets brittle or clumpy.
Perversion Mascara contains Hairdensyl, a complex blend of proteins and amino acidsâ€”including marine glycogen, known to stimulate lash growth. Honey extract provides deep nourishment, sea idrolized elastine stimulates the hair follicle, and marine collagen protects.
The twisted trim on the high-tech, volumizing brush latches on to each lash to separate and define; finally, a volumizing mascara with a clean, clump-free finish. It pulls through lashes smoothly and lays down a generous amount of product. No need to wiggle the wand or maneuver it at all different angles!
If you need to apply in public, youâ€™ll look good holding Perversion. We emblazoned our gorgeous, highly metallized black tube with a big purple â€œPerversionâ€ and our tagline: â€œBigger. Blacker. Badder.â€

The Dyson Supersonicâ„¢ hair dryer has intelligent heat control technology, which helps prevent extreme heat damage to protect hairâ€™s natural shine. The temperature is measured 20 times a second and transmits this data to the microprocessor, which intelligently controls the patented compact heating element from reaching extreme, hair damaging temperatures. The powerful tool moves over 13 liters of air every second. Combined with Dysonâ€™s patented Air Multiplierâ„¢ technology, air is amplified threefold, creating a high pressure, focused jet of air for controlled, precise, drying and styling. The digital motor V9 is on average six times faster, a third of the weight, and half the size of other hair dryer motors. Due to its compact size, Dyson was able to put the motor in the handle, making the dryer feel balanced in your hands.
Dyson has created three precisely engineered magnetic attachments with 16 patents pending, to further control the airflow, allowing you to effortlessly achieve a range of different styles. The smoothing nozzle uses smooth, wide air for a sleek finish, while the styling concentrator is for precise styling to shape hair one section at a time without worrying about disturbing the rest. The diffuser disperses air evenly around curls to gently dry hair and improve definition. With heat shield technology, the surfaces of the attachments stay coolâ€”even during close-up styling.
The Dyson Supersonic also has a removable filter at the bottom of the dryer that notifies you when it needs to be cleaned. It features four heat settings, three airflow settings, a cold shot, and ionizer, all with 1600 watts of power. This product comes with a professional-length nine-feet power cord and a two-year warranty on parts and labor.

Argan Oil is a 100% organic, chemical-free gift from nature. Its cosmetic and nutritional benefits have been the best-kept secret of Moroccan women for centuries and a secret that was whispered to me on a modeling shoot ten years ago. Moroccan argan oil is extracted from the nut of the argan tree, which grows only in the Moroccan desert. Argan oil is loaded with Vitamin E and essential fatty acids, so it has amazing healing, conditioning and repairing properties. Argan oil benefits your skin, hair, feet, nails, and even your baby's bottom. A moisturizer so pure you can use it on your baby, or use it to dress your salad? That's my idea of pure beauty. Argan Oil might not be able to solve all the worldâ€™s problems, but when it comes to your body, there isnâ€™t much it canâ€™t do. Itâ€™s light enough to use as an everyday moisturizer, and powerful enough to soothe the symptoms of skin ailments like eczema or rosacea. 
n this corner: my legendary 100% Pure Argan Oil, featherweight division. This is for those of you who love what argan oil does for your chapped skin, hair, and fine lines, and want a lighter touch for those sticky situations or humid summer days. Fighting oil with oil? It works! My Argan Oil Light absorbs even faster than the original. And it actually decreases sebum production with repeated use (sounds crazy but itâ€™s true). Get a semi-matte, radiant finish, no matter how oily your skin, and toss the blotting papers. This stuff is no lightweight when it comes to doing everything my original 100% Pure Argan Oil does: hydrating, balancing, repairing, replenishing. Itâ€™s just a shade less rich, for quicksilver absorption and a whisper-light feel.
Infused with 100% Pure Argan Oil, this plumping lip butter nourishes, conditions, soothes, and volumizes lips. The subtle sting and proprietary immediate and long-term lip-plumping complex visibly enhance lips and increases circulation for a voluptuous, juicy pout.
